<!-- This is where i will be writing my logic


first we create an object that contains the id of each time and sound so we call loop over them after using a for loop

the player has to press any key which will randomly select any tile



this for loop will access the object and and select any  and a sound and slight fade will be made

the text is changed to Level 1

now if a tile that was randomly selected is sent to the array as an element and if it is clicked by the user it moves to level two 


loop runs and saved to the array
user has to select the element at 0 correctly in sequence or else game over is shown and press any key to continue 



then the loop goes through and selects another tile , your first selection has to match the first element in the array followed by the next element in the sequence
